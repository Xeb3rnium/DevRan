Something I wrote to myself during a very dark time, hoping this makes makes it to the cold archive.
If my distant children read this a thousand years from now, please know I got better.

Kill me now, away from misery

In some field hanging from a tree.
No one knows, what I've seen.

All I want is the grass to be green.
I laugh instead because I can't scream.

Finding something to ease my pain but all I want, is to spill my brain.
Though I am dead, I'm not buried. Just a bullet through my head, and there'll be no more worries.

	Obsessed with time,
	usually in a hurry.

	There'll be a moment,
	where you'll be sorry.

	But you wont be sad 
	that I've left,

	I'll leave all my
	failures and regrets.

	Sooner or later, just not 
		yet.

When they see the flatline,
and hear that beep.

Only then, I've killed me.
